However, several days after we heard about the site, it broke down. But it is really fancy and make KevinZonda think about it day and night. Finally, KevinZonda understood that it\u2019s his dream website. But it did not belong to him, more important, it was broken. Kevin cries for days and the site still had no symptoms of recovering.</p><p><em>IELTS Writing Score</em>: <span style="color:red;">2.5</span>/9.0<br><em>Final Grade</em>: <span style="color:red;">F<sup>-</sup></span><br><em>Teacher Comments</em>: Full of grammatical and lexical mistakes.
